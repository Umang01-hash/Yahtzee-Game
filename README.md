# Yahtzee-Game
This is a ReactJS App .The objective of Yahtzee is to get as many points as possible by rolling five dice and getting certain dice combinations.
The game starts by rolling all the dice. After this either score the current roll, or re-roll any or all of the five dice. 
The dice can be rolled a total of three times â€” the initial roll, plus two re-rolls of any or all dice. After rolling three times, the roll must be scored. 
**Any roll can be scored in any category at any time, even if the resulting score is zero.**
